                <h3> C:\> MEC 2024 \ 3rd Place</h3>
                <p class="details">Nov 2024</p>
                <p>The MEC is an annual competition at McGill, made to challenge the most brilliant minds of the Engineering Faculty with complex designing problems.
                    Our team won <b>third place</b> on this competition, by designing an <b>autonomous vehicle</b> capable of sorting marbles on its path based on their size.
                    Our design achieved <b>maximum sustainability</b>, as it used the minimum quantity of resources necessary, and weighted 30% less than other design propositions.

                <h3> C:\> McGill Biomechanics \ Hardware Team</h3>
                <p class="details"> Oct 2024 - Present</p>
                <p>The Biomechanics Team is focused on the design and implementation of an upper limb exoskeleton which is able to detect and counter Parkinson tremors
                    in the patient's forearm. As a member of the hardware team, my goal is to implement electromyography (EMG) sensor and an inertial measurement unit (IMU)
                    into the exo-suit. In the Fall 2024 semester, I realized the <b>data extraction</b> system for the two sensors, as well as part of the <b>hardware design</b> of our prototype.

                <h3> C:\> McGill Vertical Flight Society \ Avionics Team</h3>
                <p class="details"> Oct 2023 - Apr 2024</p>
                <p>The Vertical Flight Society (now MDVFS) is a team focused on the design and fabrication of an electric Vertical Take-Off Landing (eVTOL) aircraft. 
                    As a member of the avionics team, our goal was to specify all the electronic requirements of the system, and to find solutions to these requirements,
                    by <b>implementing sensors</b> such as LIDAR, camera, GPS, and by making our own PCB. During the 2023-2024 year, I implemented the airspeed sensor on the eVTOL,
                    and assisted on the <b>design of different electronic components</b>.  </p>
