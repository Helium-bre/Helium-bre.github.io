                <h3> C:\> Python \ CNN-based Digit Recognizer </h3>
                <p class="details"> Dec 2024</p>
                <p>>>> A Python program capable of recognizing a handwritten digit on a 16 x 16 grid, with an <b>accuracy of 90%</b> when trained on a light dataset.
                    It implements <b>Machine Learning</b>, (a Convolutional Neural Network) with one hidden layer, and uses ReLU and sigmoid as activation functions (ReLU on hidden layer, sigmoid on output layer).
                    It only uses Python's internal libraries (random,math,tkinter,pickle).
                </p>
                <p> The applications of this program are numerous, ranging from object recognition to text generation.</p>

                <p class="details"> Nov 2024</p>
                <p>>>> A C program which can open any csv file at a given path, 
                    and that is capable of performing tasks, like addition of a row, modification of a field, sorting of different fields.</p>
                <p>This program can be used to <b>automate tasks</b> when combined with languages used to perform operations on the OS like Bash. </p>

                <p class="details"> Oct 2024</p>
                <p>>>> A Bash program which can extract informations from the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/" target="_blank">Hacker News website</a>, and output relevant informations
                in a <b>csv format</b>. It returns the 10 posts after a given rank, and extract the author, date of publication, number of upvote and title.    </p>
                <p>This program can be used for <b>data extraction from the web</b>, in order to <b>automate analysis</b> of online tendencies.</p>

                <h3> C:\> Python \ HOG feature extraction</h3>
                <p class="details">  Feb 2024</p>
                <p> >>> A Python program which can extract the HOG features of any image at a given path, which is very useful in <b>computer vision</b> tasks.
                   The Pillow library was used to process the image, and the Numpy library was used to handle the 2D array of the image.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When combined with a proper machine learning algorithm and valid training data, it can be used to perform fast and reliable object recognition.

                <h3> C:\> Python \ Maze generator</h3>
                <p class="details"> Aug 2023</p>
                <p>A Python program capable of generating a 2D maze of given dimensions. It ensures that any point A on the map can be accessed from any point B,
                    and that there is only one path to do so. It uses the Pygame library to vizualize the maze, and the internal library random to generate it.

                <p class="details">  Aug 2023</p>
                <p>A Python program that is able to find the <b>shortest path</b> between a point A and a point B in a maze, using an algorithm similar to <b>Dijkstra's algorithm</b>.
                    It uses the Numpy library to handle the 2D map, and uses Pygame to vizualize the result.

                <p class="details">  May 2023</p>
                <p>A Python program that can <b>predict the trajectory</b> of a system, if we ignore air friction, using Newton's Second Law. 
                    By giving its initial position, direction and velocity, it can determine its trajectory and speed over time.
                    It uses the math library to perform the necessary calculations, and plots the results using <b>MatPlotLib</b>.
